This project seeks to ascertain the relationship between the climate indices; "AMM", "AMO", "IOD", "NAO", "NINO1+2", "NINO3.4", "NINO3", "NINO4", "ONI", "PDO", "PNA", "SOI", "TNA", "TSA"   with temperature in Ghana. This involves the correlation between
each index with data from all 22 synoptic stations across the country to best ascertain which has a profound association with ground/gauge data and hence build a
predictive model which can be used to predict temperature in Ghana using indices with the highest highest predictive power.
